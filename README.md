### Real-Time Traffic Management System ðŸš¦
  A real-time traffic management system that visualizes traffic flow from multiple directions using Three.js and dynamically adapts traffic light signals based on real-time data.

  Key Features:

  Backend: Built with Node.js and Express.js for real-time data processing and integrated with MongoDB for data storage.
  
  Traffic Light Control: Implemented adaptive traffic light signals using Python and OpenCV for real-time traffic density detection.
  
  Optimization: Reduced congestion by optimizing signal timings using real-time data, improving overall traffic flow.
